    On the search results tables, the visual category numbers are not identical to the visually hidden category
    numbers. This means that voice control users will not be able to target the links correctly and screen readers
    will hear a different category number from the one they were expecting
  - |
    With search results tables, screen reader users are unable to tell where the beginning is, or end is for each
    section. There is also no way for them to skip past sections. This means that they will have to navigate through
    every row to find the code they need. For screen magnification users, the search results tables are difficult to
    use as there is a large amount of information to get through with limited screen space. This will mean they will
    have to navigate back and forth to ensure they are looking at the correct section

    When using a small screen, such as on a mobile phone or when using increased font sizes, the search table
    results do not fit on the screen fully
